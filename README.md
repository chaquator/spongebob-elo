# SpongeBob-Elo

SpongeBob Elo is a primitive console application written in C++ for the purpose of introducing and familiarizing myself with the C++ STL library.

SpongeBob Elo presents two SpongeBob episodes for the user to compare and input which is better, which updatesthe Elo scores of the episodes to reflect the outcome. These continuous random matchups are intended to create a contextual ranking of SpongeBob Episodes.

SpongeBob Elo creates and updates a data file so personal rankings can persist even when the application is closed. The application only works for windows because I used `pch.h` and `conio.h`.
